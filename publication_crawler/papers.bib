  abstract = {Federated Learning enables collaboratively model training among a number of distributed devices with the coordination of a centralized server, where each device alternatively performs local gradient computation and communication to the server. FL suffers from significant performance degradation due to the excessive communication delay between the server and devices, especially when the network bandwidth of these devices is limited, which is common in edge environments. Existing methods overlap the gradient computation and communication to hide the communication latency to accelerate the FL training. However, the overlapping can also lead to an inevitable gap between the local model in each device and the global model in the server that seriously restricts the convergence rate of learning process. To address this problem, we propose a new overlapping method for FL, AOCC-FL, which aligns the local model with the global model via calibrated compensation such that the communication delay can be hidden without deteriorating the convergence performance. Theoretically, we prove that AOCC-FL admits the same convergence rate as the non-overlapping method. On both simulated and testbed experiments, we show that AOCC-FL achieves a comparable convergence rate relative to the non-overlapping method while outperforming the state-of-the-art overlapping methods.},

  abstract = {Federated Distillation (FD) has recently attracted increasing attention for its efficiency in aggregating multiple diverse local models trained from statistically heterogeneous data of distributed clients. Existing FD methods generally treat these models equally by merely computing the average of their output soft predictions for some given input distillation sample, which does not take the diversity across all local models into account, thus leading to degraded performance of the aggregated model, especially when some local models learn little knowledge about the sample. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that treats the local data in each client as a specific domain and design a novel domain knowledge aware federated distillation method, dubbed DaFKD, that can discern the importance of each model to the distillation sample, and thus is able to optimize the ensemble of soft predictions from diverse models. Specifically, we employ a domain discriminator for each client, which is trained to identify the correlation factor between the sample and the corresponding domain. Then, to facilitate the training of the domain discriminator while saving communication costs, we propose sharing its partial parameters with the classification model. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that the proposed method can improve the model accuracy by up to 6.02% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {Multimodal learning (MML) aims to jointly exploit the common priors of different modalities to compensate for their inherent limitations. However, existing MML methods often optimize a uniform objective for different modalities, leading to the notorious" modality imbalance" problem and counterproductive MML performance. To address the problem, some existing methods modulate the learning pace based on the fused modality, which is dominated by the better modality and eventually results in a limited improvement on the worse modal. To better exploit the features of multimodal, we propose Prototypical Modality Rebalance (PMR) to perform stimulation on the particular slow-learning modality without interference from other modalities. Specifically, we introduce the prototypes that represent general features for each class, to build the non-parametric classifiers for uni-modal performance evaluation. Then, we try to accelerate the slow-learning modality by enhancing its clustering toward prototypes. Furthermore, to alleviate the suppression from the dominant modality, we introduce a prototype-based entropy regularization term during the early training stage to prevent premature convergence. Besides, our method only relies on the representations of each modality and without restrictions from model structures and fusion methods, making it with great application potential for various scenarios.

    abstract = {Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FedSSL) has emerged as a new paradigm for allowing distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model over scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, existing works for FedSSL rely on a closed-world assumption that all local training data and global testing data are from seen classes observed in the labeled dataset. It is crucial to go one step further: adapting FL models to an open-world setting, where unseen classes exist in the unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Federatedopen-world Semi-Supervised Learning (FedoSSL) framework, which can solve the key challenge in distributed and open-world settings, i.e., the biased training process for heterogeneously distributed unseen classes. Specifically, since the advent of a certain unseen class depends on a client basis, the locally unseen classes (exist in multiple clients) are likely to receive differentiated superior aggregation effects than the globally unseen classes (exist only in one client). We adopt an uncertainty-aware suppressed loss to alleviate the biased training between locally unseen and globally unseen classes. Besides, we enable a calibration module supplementary to the global aggregation to avoid potential conflicting knowledge transfer caused by inconsistent data distribution among different clients. The proposed FedoSSL can be easily adapted to state-of-the-art FL methods, which is also validated via extensive experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10).},

    abstract = {Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a special and practical setting in unsupervised domain adaptation, which allows a pre-trained model in a source domain to adapt to unlabeled test data in another target domain. To avoid the computation-intensive backbone fine-tuning process, the zero-shot generalization potentials of the emerging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, CoOp) are leveraged to only tune the run-time prompt for unseen test domains. However, existing solutions have yet to fully exploit the representation capabilities of pre-trained models as they only focus on the entropy-based optimization and the performance is far below the supervised prompt adaptation methods, e.g., CoOp. In this paper, we propose SwapPrompt, a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation. SwapPrompt employs a dual prompts paradigm, i.e., an online prompt and a target prompt that averaged from the online prompt to retain historical information. In addition, SwapPrompt applies a swapped prediction mechanism, which takes advantage of the representation capabilities of pre-trained models to enhance the online prompt via contrastive learning. Specifically, we use the online prompt together with an augmented view of the input image to predict the class assignment generated by the target prompt together with an alternative augmented view of the same image. The proposed SwapPrompt can be easily deployed on vision-language models without additional requirement, and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art test-time adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets. It is also shown that SwapPrompt can even achieve comparable performance with supervised prompt adaptation methods.},

  abstract={Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides additional physical channels to existing wireless network infrastructure and has attracted intensive research attention to enhance the communication capacity and extend additional user accommodation. Existing RIS researches mainly focus on optimizing the physical-layer channel utilization, and have yet to consider the multi-user fairness of the medium access process when involving the RIS channel. This article shows that RIS can lead to severely unbalanced access opportunities among RIS-assisted users and others from the experimental analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate that due to the capture effect and unbalanced receiving rate of management frames, RIS-assisted users can have unfair competitive priorities to normal users without RIS resources. To overcome such unfair access issues, we propose a novel antiunfair algorithm that allows equal access opportunities for all kinds of users in a RIS-assisted network. Specifically, we optimize the management frames' modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selections to fight against unexpected bias to balance the access opportunities. We have conducted an experimental evaluation with a practical RIS system showing that the proposed antiunfair algorithm can significantly alleviate the fairness problem without compromising the network performance.},

In such a network, the terrestrial network and satellite network are co-existing with a spectrum-sharing scheme in the presence of a multi-antenna jammer. We aim at maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users by jointly optimizing the terrestrial beamformers and IRS phase shifts while considering the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of legitimate users. Different from the non-convex optimization techniques utilized in the IRS-related problem, a novel optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages both the robustness of model-free learning approaches and the efficiency of model-based optimization methods. In the optimization module of the proposed algorithm, we analyze the smart jammer under the unknown jamming model and derive a lower bound of the anti-jamming uncertainty, such that the IRS-aided anti-jamming problem can be solved by alteration method with second-order cone programming (SOCP) algorithm and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the IRS can enhance the anti-jamming performance efficiently, and the proposed optimization-driven DRL algorithm can improve both the learning rate and the system performance compared with existing solutions.},

Large-scale concurrent access for massive wireless devices to accomplish the consensus procedure may consume prohibitive communication and computing resources, and thus may limit the application of blockchain in wireless conditions. As most existing consensus protocols are designed for wired networks, directly apply them for wireless users equipment (UEs) may exhaust their scarce spectrum and computing resources. In this paper, we propose AirCon, a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol for wireless UEs via the over-the-air computation. The novelty of AirCon is to take advantage of the intrinsic characteristic of the wireless channel and automatically achieve the consensus in the physical layer while receiving from the UEs, which greatly reduces the communication and computational cost that would be caused by traditional consensus protocols. We implement the AirCon protocol integrated into an LTE system and provide solutions to the critical issues for over-the-air consensus implementation. Experimental results are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed protocol, and simulation results to show the performance of the AirCon protocol under different wireless conditions.},

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has gained increasing attention due to its ability to collaboratively train while protecting client data privacy. However, vanilla FL cannot adapt to client heterogeneity, leading to a degradation in training efficiency due to stragglers, and is still vulnerable to privacy leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes RingSFL, a novel distributed learning scheme that integrates FL with a model split mechanism to adapt to client heterogeneity while maintaining data privacy. In RingSFL, all clients form a ring topology. For each client, instead of training the model locally, the model is split and trained among all clients along the ring through a pre-defined direction. By properly setting the propagation lengths of heterogeneous clients, the straggler effect is mitigated, and the training efficiency of the system is significantly enhanced. Additionally, since the local models are blended, it is less likely for an eavesdropper to obtain the complete model and recover the raw data, thus improving data privacy. The experimental results on both simulation and prototype systems show that RingSFL can achieve better convergence performance than benchmark methods on independently identically distributed (IID) and non-IID datasets, while effectively preventing eavesdroppers from recovering training data.},

  abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) system needs to incentivize clients since they may be reluctant to participate in the resource consuming process. Existing incentive mechanisms fail to construct a sustainable environment for the long-term development of FL system: 1) They seldom focus on system economic properties (e.g., social welfare, individual rationality, and incentive compatibility) to guarantee client attraction. 2) Current online auction modeling methods divide the whole continual process into multiple independent rounds and solve them one-by-one, which breaks the correlation between each round. Besides, the inherent characteristics of FL system (model-agnostic and privacy-sensitive) also prevent it from the optimal strategy by precise mathematical analysis. 3) Current system modelings ignore the practical problem of periodical client shifting, which cannot adaptively update its strategy to handle system dynamics. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a long-term adaptive Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism for FL system, which incorporate a multi-branch deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. First, VCG auction is the only one that can simultaneously guarantee all crucial economic properties. Second, we extend the economic properties to long-term forms and apply the experience-driven DRL algorithm to directly obtain long-term optimal strategy, without any prior system knowledge. Third, we reconstruct a multi-branch DRL network to accommodate periodical client shifting by adaptive decision head switching for different time periods. Finally, we theoretically prove he extended economic properties (i.e., IC) and conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the long-term social welfare of FL system increases by 36% with a 37% reduction in payment. Besides, the multi-branch network can adaptively handle periodical client shifting on the timeline.},

The simulation-reality distillation is conducted via personalized trace from each client correspondingly, whose performance bound is analytically guaranteed.

  abstract = {In distributed training, workers collaboratively refine the global model parameters by pushing their updates to the Parameter Server and pulling fresher parameters for the next iteration. This introduces high communication costs for training at scale, and incurs unproductive waiting time for workers. To minimize the waiting time, existing approaches overlap communication and computation for deep neural networks. Yet, these techniques not only require the layer-by-layer model structures, but also need significant efforts in runtime profiling and hyperparameter tuning. To make the overlapping optimization simple and generic , in this article, we propose a new Parameter Server framework. Our solution decouples the dependency between push and pull operations, and allows workers to eagerly pull the global parameters. This way, both push and pull operations can be easily overlapped with computations. Besides, the overlapping manner offers a different way to address the straggler problem, where the stale updates greatly retard the training process. In the new framework, with adequate information available to workers, they can explicitly modulate the learning rates for their updates. Thus, the global parameters can be less compromised by stale updates. We implement a prototype system in PyTorch and demonstrate its effectiveness on both CPU/GPU clusters. Experimental results show that our prototype saves up to 54% less time for each iteration and up to 37% fewer iterations for model convergence, achieving up to 2.86× speedup over widely-used synchronization schemes.},

  abstract = {In recent years, personalized federated learning (pFL) has attracted increasing attention for its potential in dealing with statistical heterogeneity among clients. However, the state-of-the-art pFL methods rely on model parameters aggregation at the server side, which require all models to have the same structure and size, and thus limits the application for more heterogeneous scenarios. To deal with such model constraints, we exploit the potentials of heterogeneous model settings and propose a novel training framework to employ personalized models for different clients. Specifically, we formulate the aggregation procedure in original pFL into a personalized group knowledge transfer training algorithm, namely, KT-pFL, which enables each client to maintain a personalized soft prediction at the server side to guide the others' local training. KT-pFL updates the personalized soft prediction of each client by a linear combination of all local soft predictions using a knowledge coefficient matrix, which can adaptively reinforce the collaboration among clients who own similar data distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the contributions of each client to others' personalized training, the knowledge coefficient matrix is parameterized so that it can be trained simultaneously with the models. The knowledge coefficient matrix and the model parameters are alternatively updated in each round following the gradient descent way. Extensive experiments on various datasets (EMNIST, Fashion_MNIST, CIFAR-10) are conducted under different settings (heterogeneous models and data distributions). It is demonstrated that the proposed framework is the first federated learning paradigm that realizes personalized model training via parameterized group knowledge transfer while achieving significant performance gain comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, there is a lack of good understanding on the DSRC performance in urban environments for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which impedes its reliable and efficient application. In this paper, we first conduct intensive data analytics on V2V performance, based on a large amount of real-world DSRC communications trace collected in Shanghai city, and obtain several key insights as follows. First, among many context factors, the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link condition is the major factor degrading V2V performance. Second, the durations of line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS transmission conditions follow power law distributions, which indicate that the probability of experiencing long LoS/NLoS conditions both could be high. Third, the packet inter-reception (PIR) time distribution follows an exponential distribution in the LoS conditions but a power law in the NLoS conditions, which means that the consecutive packet reception failures rarely appear in the LoS conditions but can constantly appear in the NLoS conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a context-aware reliable beaconing scheme, called CoBe, to enhance the broadcast reliability for safety applications. The CoBe is a fully distributed scheme, in which a vehicle first detects the link condition with each of its neighbors by machine learning algorithms, then exchanges such link condition information with its neighbors, and finally selects the minimal number of helper vehicles to rebroadcast its beacons to those neighbors in bad link condition. To analyze and evaluate the CoBe performance, a two-state Markov chain is devised to model beaconing behaviors.
