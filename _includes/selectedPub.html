                                <p>Federated Learning enables collaboratively model training among a number of
                                    distributed devices with the coordination of a centralized server, where
                                    each device alternatively performs local gradient computation and
                                    communication to the server. FL suffers from significant performance
                                    degradation due to the excessive communication delay between the server and
                                    devices, especially when the network bandwidth of these devices is limited,
                                    which is common in edge environments. Existing methods overlap the gradient
                                    computation and communication to hide the communication latency to
                                    accelerate the FL training. However, the overlapping can also lead to an
                                    inevitable gap between the local model in each device and the global model
                                    in the server that seriously restricts the convergence rate of learning
                                    process. To address this problem, we propose a new overlapping method for
                                    FL, AOCC-FL, which aligns the local model with the global model via
                                    calibrated compensation such that the communication delay can be hidden
                                    without deteriorating the convergence performance. Theoretically, we prove
                                    that AOCC-FL admits the same convergence rate as the non-overlapping method.
                                    On both simulated and testbed experiments, we show that AOCC-FL achieves a
                                    comparable convergence rate relative to the non-overlapping method while
                                    outperforming the state-of-the-art overlapping methods.</p>

                                <p>Federated Distillation (FD) has recently attracted increasing attention for
                                    its efficiency in aggregating multiple diverse local models trained from
                                    statistically heterogeneous data of distributed clients. Existing FD methods
                                    generally treat these models equally by merely computing the average of
                                    their output soft predictions for some given input distillation sample,
                                    which does not take the diversity across all local models into account, thus
                                    leading to degraded performance of the aggregated model, especially when
                                    some local models learn little knowledge about the sample. In this paper, we
                                    propose a new perspective that treats the local data in each client as a
                                    specific domain and design a novel domain knowledge aware federated
                                    distillation method, dubbed DaFKD, that can discern the importance of each
                                    model to the distillation sample, and thus is able to optimize the ensemble
                                    of soft predictions from diverse models. Specifically, we employ a domain
                                    discriminator for each client, which is trained to identify the correlation
                                    factor between the sample and the corresponding domain. Then, to facilitate
                                    the training of the domain discriminator while saving communication costs,
                                    we propose sharing its partial parameters with the classification model.
                                    Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that the
                                    proposed method can improve the model accuracy by up to 6.02% compared to
                                    state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                                <p>Multimodal learning (MML) aims to jointly exploit the common priors of
                                    different modalities to compensate for their inherent limitations. However,
                                    existing MML methods often optimize a uniform objective for different
                                    modalities, leading to the notorious" modality imbalance" problem and
                                    counterproductive MML performance. To address the problem, some existing
                                    methods modulate the learning pace based on the fused modality, which is
                                    dominated by the better modality and eventually results in a limited
                                    improvement on the worse modal. To better exploit the features of
                                    multimodal, we propose Prototypical Modality Rebalance (PMR) to perform
                                    stimulation on the particular slow-learning modality without interference
                                    from other modalities. Specifically, we introduce the prototypes that
                                    represent general features for each class, to build the non-parametric
                                    classifiers for uni-modal performance evaluation. Then, we try to accelerate
                                    the slow-learning modality by enhancing its clustering toward prototypes.
                                    Furthermore, to alleviate the suppression from the dominant modality, we
                                    introduce a prototype-based entropy regularization term during the early
                                    training stage to prevent premature convergence. Besides, our method only
                                    relies on the representations of each modality and without restrictions from
                                    model structures and fusion methods, making it with great application
                                    potential for various scenarios. The source code is available here.</p>

                                <p>Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FedSSL) has emerged as a new paradigm for
                                    allowing distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning
                                    model over scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,
                                    existing works for FedSSL rely on a closed-world assumption that all local
                                    training data and global testing data are from seen classes observed in the
                                    labeled dataset. It is crucial to go one step further: adapting FL models to
                                    an open-world setting, where unseen classes exist in the unlabeled data. In
                                    this paper, we propose a novel Federatedopen-world Semi-Supervised Learning
                                    (FedoSSL) framework, which can solve the key challenge in distributed and
                                    open-world settings, i.e., the biased training process for heterogeneously
                                    distributed unseen classes. Specifically, since the advent of a certain
                                    unseen class depends on a client basis, the locally unseen classes (exist in
                                    multiple clients) are likely to receive differentiated superior aggregation
                                    effects than the globally unseen classes (exist only in one client). We
                                    adopt an uncertainty-aware suppressed loss to alleviate the biased training
                                    between locally unseen and globally unseen classes. Besides, we enable a
                                    calibration module supplementary to the global aggregation to avoid
                                    potential conflicting knowledge transfer caused by inconsistent data
                                    distribution among different clients. The proposed FedoSSL can be easily
                                    adapted to state-of-the-art FL methods, which is also validated via
                                    extensive experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets (CIFAR-10,

                                <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a special and practical setting in unsupervised
                                    domain adaptation, which allows a pre-trained model in a source domain to
                                    adapt to unlabeled test data in another target domain. To avoid the
                                    computation-intensive backbone fine-tuning process, the zero-shot
                                    generalization potentials of the emerging pre-trained vision-language models
                                    (e.g., CLIP, CoOp) are leveraged to only tune the run-time prompt for unseen
                                    test domains. However, existing solutions have yet to fully exploit the
                                    representation capabilities of pre-trained models as they only focus on the
                                    entropy-based optimization and the performance is far below the supervised
                                    prompt adaptation methods, e.g., CoOp. In this paper, we propose SwapPrompt,
                                    a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised
                                    contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation.
                                    SwapPrompt employs a dual prompts paradigm, i.e., an online prompt and a
                                    target prompt that averaged from the online prompt to retain historical
                                    information. In addition, SwapPrompt applies a swapped prediction mechanism,
                                    which takes advantage of the representation capabilities of pre-trained
                                    models to enhance the online prompt via contrastive learning. Specifically,
                                    we use the online prompt together with an augmented view of the input image
                                    to predict the class assignment generated by the target prompt together with
                                    an alternative augmented view of the same image. The proposed SwapPrompt can
                                    be easily deployed on vision-language models without additional requirement,
                                    and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art test-time
                                    adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets. It is also shown
                                    that SwapPrompt can even achieve comparable performance with supervised
                                    prompt adaptation methods.</p>

                                <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides additional physical
                                    channels to existing wireless network infrastructure and has attracted
                                    intensive research attention to enhance the communication capacity and
                                    extend additional user accommodation. Existing RIS researches mainly focus
                                    on optimizing the physical-layer channel utilization, and have yet to
                                    consider the multi-user fairness of the medium access process when involving
                                    the RIS channel. This article shows that RIS can lead to severely unbalanced
                                    access opportunities among RIS-assisted users and others from the
                                    experimental analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate that due to the capture
                                    effect and unbalanced receiving rate of management frames, RIS-assisted
                                    users can have unfair competitive priorities to normal users without RIS
                                    resources. To overcome such unfair access issues, we propose a novel
                                    antiunfair algorithm that allows equal access opportunities for all kinds of
                                    users in a RIS-assisted network. Specifically, we optimize the management
                                    frames’ modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selections to fight against
                                    unexpected bias to balance the access opportunities. We have conducted an
                                    experimental evaluation with a practical RIS system showing that the
                                    proposed antiunfair algorithm can significantly alleviate the fairness
                                    problem without compromising the network performance.</p>

                                <p>This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) aided
                                    anti-jamming communication strategy in the integrated terrestrial-satellite
                                    network (ITSN), where the IRS is exploited to mitigate jamming interference
                                    and enhance the integrated system communication performance. In such a
                                    network, the terrestrial network and satellite network are co-existing with
                                    a spectrum-sharing scheme in the presence of a multi-antenna jammer. We aim
                                    at maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users by jointly optimizing
                                    the terrestrial beamformers and IRS phase shifts while considering the
                                    signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of legitimate
                                    users. Different from the non-convex optimization techniques utilized in the
                                    IRS-related problem, a novel optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning
                                    (DRL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages both the robustness of
                                    model-free learning approaches and the efficiency of model-based
                                    optimization methods. In the optimization module of the proposed algorithm,
                                    we analyze the smart jammer under the unknown jamming model and derive a
                                    lower bound of the anti-jamming uncertainty, such that the IRS-aided
                                    anti-jamming problem can be solved by alteration method with second-order
                                    cone programming (SOCP) algorithm and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
                                    technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the IRS can enhance the
                                    anti-jamming performance efficiently, and the proposed optimization-driven
                                    DRL algorithm can improve both the learning rate and the system performance
                                    compared with existing solutions.</p>

                                <p>Blockchain has been deemed as a promising solution for providing security and
                                    privacy protection in the next-generation wireless networks. Large-scale
                                    concurrent access for massive wireless devices to accomplish the consensus
                                    procedure may consume prohibitive communication and computing resources, and
                                    thus may limit the application of blockchain in wireless conditions. As most
                                    existing consensus protocols are designed for wired networks, directly apply
                                    them for wireless users equipment (UEs) may exhaust their scarce spectrum
                                    and computing resources. In this paper, we propose AirCon, a byzantine
                                    fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol for wireless UEs via the
                                    over-the-air computation. The novelty of AirCon is to take advantage of the
                                    intrinsic characteristic of the wireless channel and automatically achieve
                                    the consensus in the physical layer while receiving from the UEs, which
                                    greatly reduces the communication and computational cost that would be
                                    caused by traditional consensus protocols. We implement the AirCon protocol
                                    integrated into an LTE system and provide solutions to the critical issues
                                    for over-the-air consensus implementation. Experimental results are provided
                                    to show the feasibility of the proposed protocol, and simulation results to

                                <p>Federated learning (FL) has gained increasing attention due to its ability to
                                    collaboratively train while protecting client data privacy. However, vanilla
                                    FL cannot adapt to client heterogeneity, leading to a degradation in
                                    training efficiency due to stragglers, and is still vulnerable to privacy
                                    leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes RingSFL, a novel
                                    distributed learning scheme that integrates FL with a model split mechanism
                                    to adapt to client heterogeneity while maintaining data privacy. In RingSFL,
                                    all clients form a ring topology. For each client, instead of training the
                                    model locally, the model is split and trained among all clients along the
                                    ring through a pre-defined direction. By properly setting the propagation
                                    lengths of heterogeneous clients, the straggler effect is mitigated, and the
                                    training efficiency of the system is significantly enhanced. Additionally,
                                    since the local models are blended, it is less likely for an eavesdropper to
                                    obtain the complete model and recover the raw data, thus improving data
                                    privacy. The experimental results on both simulation and prototype systems
                                    show that RingSFL can achieve better convergence performance than benchmark
                                    methods on independently identically distributed (IID) and non-IID datasets,
                                    while effectively preventing eavesdroppers from recovering training data.

                                <p>Federated Learning (FL) system needs to incentivize clients since they may be
                                    reluctant to participate in the resource consuming process. Existing
                                    incentive mechanisms fail to construct a sustainable environment for the
                                    long-term development of FL system: 1) They seldom focus on system economic
                                    properties (e.g., social welfare, individual rationality, and incentive
                                    compatibility) to guarantee client attraction. 2) Current online auction
                                    modeling methods divide the whole continual process into multiple
                                    independent rounds and solve them one-by-one, which breaks the correlation
                                    between each round. Besides, the inherent characteristics of FL system
                                    (model-agnostic and privacy-sensitive) also prevent it from the optimal
                                    strategy by precise mathematical analysis. 3) Current system modelings
                                    ignore the practical problem of periodical client shifting, which cannot
                                    adaptively update its strategy to handle system dynamics. To overcome the
                                    above challenges, this paper proposes a long-term adaptive
                                    Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism for FL system, which
                                    incorporate a multi-branch deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm.
                                    First, VCG auction is the only one that can simultaneously guarantee all
                                    crucial economic properties. Second, we extend the economic properties to
                                    long-term forms and apply the experience-driven DRL algorithm to directly
                                    obtain long-term optimal strategy, without any prior system knowledge.
                                    Third, we reconstruct a multi-branch DRL network to accommodate periodical
                                    client shifting by adaptive decision head switching for different time
                                    periods. Finally, we theoretically prove he extended economic properties
                                    (i.e., IC) and conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets.
                                    Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the long-term social welfare of
                                    FL system increases by 36% with a 37% reduction in payment. Besides, the
                                    multi-branch network can adaptively handle periodical client shifting on the
                                    timeline.</p>

                                <p>Packet loss inferring can enable a transceiver to distinguish between channel
                                    impairment and collision for transmission failures, and thus can improve the
                                    network performance by exclusively performing rate adaptation or adjusting
                                    the medium access parameter. Machine learning methods from literature have
                                    shown great potential in producing models that can detect the loss causes
                                    over various network trace, however haven’t considered accurate data-driven
                                    loss inferring on resource-constrained devices that cannot accommodate deep
                                    models. In this paper, we propose a novel packet loss inferring framework
                                    that can train lightweight models to distinguish between channel losses and
                                    collisions by learning the data trace from both simulation and real devices.
                                    Specifically, we first train a sophisticated teacher model based on
                                    extensive simulation datasets, whose knowledge is then transferred to a
                                    small student model that can be deployed on tiny device. The
                                    simulation-reality distillation is conducted via personalized trace from
                                    each client correspondingly, whose performance bound is analytically
                                    guaranteed. We have implemented our method on real testbed and show that the
                                    network access performance can be significantly improved, especially for

                                <p>In distributed training, workers collaboratively refine the global model
                                    parameters by pushing their updates to the Parameter Server and pulling
                                    fresher parameters for the next iteration. This introduces high
                                    communication costs for training at scale, and incurs unproductive waiting
                                    time for workers. To minimize the waiting time, existing approaches overlap
                                    communication and computation for deep neural networks. Yet, these
                                    techniques not only require the layer-by-layer model structures, but also
                                    need significant efforts in runtime profiling and hyperparameter tuning. To
                                    make the overlapping optimization simple and generic , in this article, we
                                    propose a new Parameter Server framework. Our solution decouples the
                                    dependency between push and pull operations, and allows workers to eagerly
                                    pull the global parameters. This way, both push and pull operations can be
                                    easily overlapped with computations. Besides, the overlapping manner offers
                                    a different way to address the straggler problem, where the stale updates
                                    greatly retard the training process. In the new framework, with adequate
                                    information available to workers, they can explicitly modulate the learning
                                    rates for their updates. Thus, the global parameters can be less compromised
                                    by stale updates. We implement a prototype system in PyTorch and demonstrate
                                    its effectiveness on both CPU/GPU clusters. Experimental results show that
                                    our prototype saves up to 54% less time for each iteration and up to 37%
                                    fewer iterations for model convergence, achieving up to 2.86× speedup over
                                    widely-used synchronization schemes.</p>

                                <p>In recent years, personalized federated learning (pFL) has attracted
                                    increasing attention for its potential in dealing with statistical
                                    heterogeneity among clients. However, the state-of-the-art pFL methods rely
                                    on model parameters aggregation at the server side, which require all models
                                    to have the same structure and size, and thus limits the application for
                                    more heterogeneous scenarios. To deal with such model constraints, we
                                    exploit the potentials of heterogeneous model settings and propose a novel
                                    training framework to employ personalized models for different clients.
                                    Specifically, we formulate the aggregation procedure in original pFL into a
                                    personalized group knowledge transfer training algorithm, namely, KT-pFL,
                                    which enables each client to maintain a personalized soft prediction at the
                                    server side to guide the others’ local training. KT-pFL updates the
                                    personalized soft prediction of each client by a linear combination of all
                                    local soft predictions using a knowledge coefficient matrix, which can
                                    adaptively reinforce the collaboration among clients who own similar data
                                    distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the contributions of each client to
                                    others’ personalized training, the knowledge coefficient matrix is
                                    parameterized so that it can be trained simultaneously with the models. The
                                    knowledge coefficient matrix and the model parameters are alternatively
                                    updated in each round following the gradient descent way. Extensive
                                    experiments on various datasets (EMNIST, Fashion_MNIST, CIFAR-10) are
                                    conducted under different settings (heterogeneous models and data
                                    distributions). It is demonstrated that the proposed framework is the first
                                    federated learning paradigm that realizes personalized model training via
                                    parameterized group knowledge transfer while achieving significant
                                    performance gain comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

                                <p>Wireless service providers (WSPs) are seeking cooperation to share both
                                    resources (spectrum, infrastructures) and costs. In particular, cooperation
                                    is critical for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications that value
                                    quality-of-service foremost. However, cooperation is inefficient without
                                    strong trust bases. Recently, blockchain arises as a promising solution to
                                    decentralized trust, owing to its transparency and immutability. Therefore,
                                    we propose a WSP cooperation framework based on blockchain, which keeps a
                                    shared ledger on resource utilization. In this paper, we first study the WSP
                                    selection problem of vehicles by evolutionary game. Then, we make the
                                    blockchain public to vehicles to maintain its decentralization and enhance
                                    its security by crowdsourcing idle computing resources from vehicles. To
                                    deal with the mobility of vehicles, as well as to improve the consensus
                                    efficiency, we propose delegated proof-of-work (DPoW) scheme, which
                                    introduces delegate nodes for participating in the blockchain consensus on
                                    behalf of the vehicles. The alternating direction method of multipliers
                                    (ADMM) optimization framework is further used to derive optimal consensus
                                    parameters including block size, computing resource demand of delegate
                                    nodes, and prices paid for vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to
                                    show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p>

                                <p>With its potential versatility and reliability, the space-air-ground
                                    integrated vehicular network (SAGVN) is envisioned as a promising solution
                                    to deliver quality vehicular services anywhere at any time. This article
                                    proposes a software defined framework for SAGVN to achieve flexible,
                                    reliable, and scalable network resource management. First, key applications
                                    and research challenges in resource management are identified. Then we
                                    propose a hybrid and hierarchical SAGVN control architecture to balance the
                                    trade-off between system status acquisition and signaling overhead in
                                    different scenarios. Considering the dynamic networking environment with
                                    multi-dimensional resources and diverse services, it is challenging to make
                                    optimal resource management decisions in real time; thus, artificial
                                    intelligence (AI)-based engineering solutions are investigated to facilitate
                                    efficient network slicing, mobility management, and cooperative content
                                    caching and delivery. A trace-driven case study is presented to demonstrate
                                    the effectiveness of the proposed SAGVN framework with AI-based methods in
                                    increasing the SAGVN throughput performance.</p>

                                <p>The IEEE 802.11p-based dedicated short range communication (DSRC) is
                                    essential to enhance driving safety and improve road efficiency by enabling
                                    rapid cooperative message exchanging. However, there is a lack of good
                                    understanding on the DSRC performance in urban environments for
                                    vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which impedes its reliable and
                                    efficient application. In this paper, we first conduct intensive data
                                    analytics on V2V performance, based on a large amount of real-world DSRC
                                    communications trace collected in Shanghai city, and obtain several key
                                    insights as follows. First, among many context factors, the
                                    non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link condition is the major factor degrading V2V
                                    performance. Second, the durations of line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS
                                    transmission conditions follow power law distributions, which indicate that
                                    the probability of experiencing long LoS/NLoS conditions both could be high.
                                    Third, the packet inter-reception (PIR) time distribution follows an
                                    exponential distribution in the LoS conditions but a power law in the NLoS
                                    conditions, which means that the consecutive packet reception failures
                                    rarely appear in the LoS conditions but can constantly appear in the NLoS
                                    conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a context-aware reliable
                                    beaconing scheme, called CoBe, to enhance the broadcast reliability for
                                    safety applications. The CoBe is a fully distributed scheme, in which a
                                    vehicle first detects the link condition with each of its neighbors by
                                    machine learning algorithms, then exchanges such link condition information
                                    with its neighbors, and finally selects the minimal number of helper
                                    vehicles to rebroadcast its beacons to those neighbors in bad link
                                    condition. To analyze and evaluate the CoBe performance, a two-state Markov
                                    chain is devised to model beaconing behaviors. The extensive trace-driven
                                    simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of CoBe.</p>

                                <p>As the rapid development of automotive telematics, modern vehicles are
                                    expected to be connected through heterogeneous radio access technologies and
                                    are able to exchange massive information with their surrounding environment.
                                    By significantly expanding the network scale and conducting both real time
                                    and long term information processing, the traditional Vehicular Ad-Hoc
                                    Networks (VANETs) are evolving to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which
                                    promises efficient and intelligent prospect for the future transportation
                                    system. On the other hand, vehicles are not only consuming but also
                                    generating a huge amount and enormous types of data, which are referred to
                                    as Big Data. In this article, we first investigate the relationship between
                                    IoV and big data in vehicular environment, mainly on how IoV supports the
                                    transmission, storage, computing of the big data, and in return how IoV
                                    benefits from big data in terms of IoV characterization, performance
                                    evaluation and big data assisted communication protocol design. We then
                                    investigate the application of IoV big data for autonomous vehicles. Finally
                                    the emerging issues of the big data enabled IoV are discussed.</p>
