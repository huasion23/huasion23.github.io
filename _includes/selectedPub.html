                                <p>Recently, Multimodal Learning (MML) has gained significant interest as it compensates for single-modality limitations through comprehensive complementary information within multimodal data. However, traditional MML methods generally use the joint learning framework with a uniform learning objective that can lead to the modality competition issue, where feedback predominantly comes from certain modalities, limiting the full potential of others. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces DI-MML, a novel detached MML framework designed to learn complementary information across modalities under the premise of avoiding modality competition. Specifically, DI-MML addresses competition by separately training each modality encoder with isolated learning objectives. It further encourages cross-modal interaction via a shared classifier that defines a common feature space and employing a dimension-decoupled unidirectional contrastive (DUC) loss to facilitate modality-level knowledge transfer. Additionally, to account for varying reliability in sample pairs, we devise a certainty-aware logit weighting strategy to effectively leverage complementary information at the instance level during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on audio-visual, flow-image, and front-rear view datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method.</p>

                                <p>This paper focuses on Federated Domain-Incremental Learning (FDIL) where each client continues to learn incremental tasks where their domain shifts from each other. We propose a novel adaptive knowledge matching-based personalized FDIL approach (pFedDIL) which allows each client to alternatively utilize appropriate incremental task learning strategy on the correlation with the knowledge from previous tasks. More specifically, when a new task arrives, each client first calculates its local correlations with previous tasks. Then, the client can choose to adopt a new initial model or a previous model with similar knowledge to train the new task and simultaneously migrate knowledge from previous tasks based on these correlations. Furthermore, to identify the correlations between the new task and previous tasks for each client, we separately employ an auxiliary classifier to each target classification model and propose sharing partial parameters between the target classification model and the auxiliary classifier to condense model parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of which results demonstrate that pFedDIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 14.35\% in terms of average accuracy of all tasks.</p>

                                <p>Selecting proper clients to participate in each federated learning (FL) round is critical to effectively harness a broad range of distributed data. Existing client selection methods simply consider to mine the distributed uni-modal data, yet, their effectiveness may diminish in multi-modal FL (MFL) as the modality imbalance problem not only impedes the collaborative local training but also lead to a severe global modality-level bias. We empirically reveal that local training with a certain single modality may contribute more to the global model than training with all local modalities. To effectively exploit the distributed multimodalities, we propose a novel Balanced Modality Selection framework for MFL (BMSFed) to overcome the modal bias. On the one hand, we introduce a modal enhancement loss during local training to alleviate local imbalance based on the aggregated global prototypes. On the other hand, we propose the modality selection aiming to select subsets of local modalities with great diversity and achieving global modal balance simultaneously. Our extensive experiments on audio-visual, colored-gray, and front-back datasets showcase the superiority of BMSFed over baselines and its effectiveness in multi-modal data exploitation.</p>

                                <p>Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods typically focus on transferring knowledge from a large-capacity teacher to a low-capacity student model, achieving substantial success in unimodal knowledge transfer. However, existing methods can hardly be extended to Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (CMKD), where the knowledge is transferred from a teacher modality to a different student modality, with inference only on the distilled student modality. We empirically reveal that the modality gap, i.e., modality imbalance and soft label misalignment, incurs the in- effectiveness of traditional KD in CMKD. As a solution, we propose a novel Customized Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation (C2KD). Specifically, to alleviate the modality gap, the pre-trained teacher performs bidirectional distillation with the student to provide customized knowledge. The On-the-Fly Selection Distillation(OFSD) strategy is ap- plied to selectively filter out the samples with misaligned soft labels, where we distill cross-modal knowledge from non-target classes to avoid the modality imbalance issue. To further provide receptive cross-modal knowledge, proxy student and teacher, inheriting unimodal and cross-modal knowledge, is formulated to progressively transfer cross- modal knowledge through bidirectional distillation. Experimental results on audio-visual, image-text, and RGB-depth datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively trans- fer knowledge across modalities, achieving superior performance against traditional KD by a large margin.</p>

                                <p>Federated learning is a promising distributed machine learning paradigm that can effectively exploit large-scale data without exposing users’ privacy. However, it may incur significant communication overhead, thereby potentially impairing the training efficiency. To address this challenge, numerous studies suggest binarizing the model updates, which can reduce the communication data volume significantly. Nonetheless, traditional methods usually binarize model updates in a post-training manner, resulting in significant approximation errors and consequent degradation in model accuracy. To this end, we propose Federated Binarization-aware Training (FedBAT), a novel framework that directly learns binary model updates during the local training process, thus inherently reducing the approximation errors. FedBAT incorporates an innovative binarization operator, along with meticulously designed derivatives to facilitate efficient learning. In addition, we establish theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence of FedBAT. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular datasets. The results show that FedBAT significantly accelerates the convergence and exceeds the accuracy of binarization methods by up to 9%, even surpassing that of FedAvg in some cases.</p>

                                <p>Many existing anomaly detection methods assume the availability of a large-scale normal dataset. But for many applications, limited by resources, removing all anomalous samples from a large unlabeled dataset is unrealistic, resulting in contaminated datasets. To detect anomalies accurately under such scenarios, from the probabilistic perspective, the key question becomes how to learn the normal-data distribution from a contaminated dataset. To this end, we propose to collect two additional small datasets that are comprised of partially-observed normal and anomaly samples, and then use them to help learn the distribution under an adversarial learning scheme. We prove that under some mild conditions, the proposed method is able to learn the correct normal-data distribution. Then, we consider the overfitting issue caused by the small size of the two additional datasets, and a correctness-guaranteed flipping mechanism is further developed to alleviate it. Theoretical results under incomplete observed anomaly types are also presented. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms representative baselines when detecting anomalies under contaminated datasets.</p>

                                <p>Fine-tuning the learnable prompt for a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), such as CLIP, has demonstrated exceptional efficiency in adapting to a broad range of downstream tasks. Existing prompt tuning methods for VLMs do not distinguish spurious features introduced by biased training data from invariant features, and employ a uniform alignment process when adapting to unseen target domains. This can impair the cross-modal feature alignment when the test data significantly deviate from the distribution of the training data, resulting in a poor out-ofdistribution (OOD) generalization performance. In this paper, we reveal that the prompt tuning failure in such OOD scenarios can be attribute to the undesired alignment between the textual and the spurious feature. As a solution, we propose CoOPood, a fine-grained prompt tuning method that can discern the causal features and deliberately align the text modality with the invariant feature. Specifically, we design two independent contrastive phases using two lightweight projection layers during the alignment, each with different objectives: 1) pulling the text embedding closer to the invariant image embedding and 2) pushing the text embedding away from the spurious image embedding. We have illustrated that CoOPood can serve as a general framework for VLMs and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt tuning methods. Extensive experiments on various OOD datasets demonstrate the performance superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

                                <p>Transformer model empowered architectures have become a pillar of cloud
                                    services that keeps reshaping our society. However, the dynamic query loads
                                    and heterogeneous user requirements severely challenge current transformer
                                    serving systems, which rely on pre-training multiple variants of a
                                    foundation model, i.e., with different sizes, to accommodate varying service
                                    demands. Unfortunately, such a mechanism is unsuitable for large transformer
                                    models due to the prohibitive training costs and excessive I/O delay. In
                                    this paper, we introduce OTAS, the first elastic serving system specially
                                    tailored for transformer models by exploring lightweight token management.
                                    We develop a novel idea called token adaptation that adds prompting tokens
                                    to improve accuracy and removes redundant tokens to accelerate inference. To
                                    cope with fluctuating query loads and diverse user requests, we enhance OTAS
                                    with application-aware selective batching and online token adaptation. OTAS
                                    first batches incoming queries with similar service-level objectives to
                                    improve the ingress throughput. Then, to strike a tradeoff between the
                                    overhead of token increment and the potentials for accuracy improvement,
                                    OTAS adaptively adjusts the token execution strategy by solving an
                                    optimization problem. We implement and evaluate a prototype of OTAS with
                                    multiple datasets, which show that OTAS improves the system utility by at
                                    least 18.2%.</p>

                                <p>Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) can effectively exploit the non-IID
                                    data from distributed clients by customizing personalized models. Existing
                                    pFL methods either simply take the local model as a whole for aggregation or
                                    require significant training overhead to induce the inter-client
                                    personalized weights, and thus clients cannot efficiently exploit the
                                    mutually relevant knowledge from each other. In this paper, we propose a
                                    knowledge-aware parameter coaching scheme where each client can swiftly and
                                    granularly refer to parameters of other clients to guide the local training,
                                    whereby accurate personalized client models can be efficiently produced
                                    without contradictory knowledge. Specifically, a novel regularizer is
                                    designed to conduct layer-wise parameters coaching via a relation cube,
                                    which is constructed based on the knowledge represented by the layered
                                    parameters among all clients. Then, we develop an optimization method to
                                    update the relation cube and the parameters of each client. It is
                                    theoretically demonstrated that the convergence of the proposed method can
                                    be guaranteed under both convex and non-convex settings. Extensive
                                    experiments are conducted over various datasets, which show that the
                                    proposed method can achieve better performance compared with the
                                    state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.</p>

                                <p>This paper investigates a new, practical, but challenging problem named
                                    Non-exemplar Online Class-incremental continual Learning (NO-CL), which aims
                                    to preserve the discernibility of base classes without buffering data
                                    examples and efficiently learn novel classes continuously in a single-pass
                                    (i.e., online) data stream. The challenges of this task are mainly two-fold:
                                    (1) Both base and novel classes suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting
                                    as no previous samples are available for replay. (2) As the online data can
                                    only be observed once, there is no way to fully re-train the whole model,
                                    e.g., re-calibrate the decision boundaries via prototype alignment or
                                    feature distillation. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-prototype
                                    Self-augment and Refinement method (DSR) for NO-CL problem, which consists
                                    of two strategies: 1) Dual class prototypes: vanilla and high-dimensional
                                    prototypes are exploited to utilize the pre-trained information and obtain
                                    robust quasi-orthogonal representations rather than example buffers for both
                                    privacy preservation and memory reduction. 2) Self-augment and refinement:
                                    Instead of updating the whole network, we optimize high-dimensional
                                    prototypes alternatively with the extra projection module based on
                                    self-augment vanilla prototypes, through a bi-level optimization problem.
                                    Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
                                    proposed DSR in NO-CL.</p>

                                <p>Open-World Compositional Zero-shot Learning (OW-CZSL) aims to recognize novel
                                    compositions of state and object primitives in images with no priors on the
                                    compositional space, which induces a tremendously large output space
                                    containing all possible state-object compositions. Existing works either
                                    learn the joint compositional state-object embedding or predict simple
                                    primitives with separate classifiers. However, the former method heavily
                                    relies on external word embedding methods, and the latter ignores the
                                    interactions of interdependent primitives, respectively. In this paper, we
                                    revisit the primitive prediction approach and propose a novel method, termed
                                    Progressive Cross-primitive Compatibility (ProCC), to mimic the human
                                    learning process for OW-CZSL tasks. Specifically, the cross-primitive
                                    compatibility module explicitly learns to model the interactions of state
                                    and object features with the trainable memory units, which efficiently
                                    acquires cross-primitive visual attention to reason high-feasibility
                                    compositions, without the aid of external knowledge. Moreover, to alleviate
                                    the invalid cross-primitive interactions, especially for partial-supervision
                                    conditions (pCZSL), we design a progressive training paradigm to optimize
                                    the primitive classifiers conditioned on pretrained features in an
                                    easy-to-hard manner. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark
                                    datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other representative
                                    methods on both OW-CZSL and pCZSL settings by large margins.</p>

                                <p>Machine learning models are widely applied for vehicular applications, which
                                    are essential to future intelligent transportation system (ITS). Traditional
                                    model training methods commonly employ a client-server architecture to
                                    perform local training and global iterative aggregations, which can consume
                                    significant bandwidth resources that are often absent in vehicular networks,
                                    especially in high vehicle density scenarios. Modern vehicle users naturally
                                    can collaboratively train machine learning models as they are the data owner
                                    and have strong local computing power from the onboard units (OBU). In this
                                    paper, we propose a novel collaborative learning scheme for mobile vehicles
                                    that can utilize the opportunistic vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) communication
                                    to exploit the common priors of vehicular data without interaction with a
                                    centralized coordinator. Specifically, vehicles perform local training
                                    during the driving journey, and simply upload its local model to roadside
                                    unit (RSU) encountered on the way. RSU’s model will be updated accordingly
                                    and sent back to the vehicle via the V2R communication. We have
                                    theoretically shown that RSUs’ models can eventually converge without a
                                    backhaul connection. Extensive experiments upon various road configurations
                                    demonstrate that the proposed scheme can efficiently train models among
                                    vehicles without dedicated Internet access and scale well with both the road
                                    range and vehicle density.</p>

                                <p>Feature interaction networks are crucial for click-through rate (CTR)
                                    prediction in many applications. Extensive studies have been conducted to
                                    boost CTR accuracy by constructing effective structures of models. However,
                                    the performance of feature interaction networks is greatly influenced by the
                                    prior assumptions made by the model designer regarding its structure.
                                    Furthermore, the structures of models are highly interdependent, and
                                    launching models in different scenarios can be arduous and time-consuming.
                                    To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework called DTR,
                                    which redefines the CTR feature interaction paradigm from a new perspective,
                                    allowing for the decoupling of its structure. Specifically, DTR first
                                    decomposes these models into individual structures and then reconstructs
                                    them within a unified model structure space, consisting of three stages:
                                    Mask, Kernel, and Compression. Each stage of DTR’s exploration of a range of
                                    structures is guided by the characteristics of the dataset or the scenario.
                                    Theoretically, we prove that the structure space of DTR not only
                                    incorporates a wide range of state-of-the-art models but also provides
                                    potentials to identify better models. Experiments on two public real-world
                                    datasets demonstrate the superiority of DTR, which outperforms
                                    state-of-the-art models.</p>

                                <p>Federated Learning enables collaboratively model training among a number of
                                    distributed devices with the coordination of a centralized server, where
                                    each device alternatively performs local gradient computation and
                                    communication to the server. FL suffers from significant performance
                                    degradation due to the excessive communication delay between the server and
                                    devices, especially when the network bandwidth of these devices is limited,
                                    which is common in edge environments. Existing methods overlap the gradient
                                    computation and communication to hide the communication latency to
                                    accelerate the FL training. However, the overlapping can also lead to an
                                    inevitable gap between the local model in each device and the global model
                                    in the server that seriously restricts the convergence rate of learning
                                    process. To address this problem, we propose a new overlapping method for
                                    FL, AOCC-FL, which aligns the local model with the global model via
                                    calibrated compensation such that the communication delay can be hidden
                                    without deteriorating the convergence performance. Theoretically, we prove
                                    that AOCC-FL admits the same convergence rate as the non-overlapping method.
                                    On both simulated and testbed experiments, we show that AOCC-FL achieves a
                                    comparable convergence rate relative to the non-overlapping method while
                                    outperforming the state-of-the-art overlapping methods.</p>

                                <p>Federated Distillation (FD) has recently attracted increasing attention for
                                    its efficiency in aggregating multiple diverse local models trained from
                                    statistically heterogeneous data of distributed clients. Existing FD methods
                                    generally treat these models equally by merely computing the average of
                                    their output soft predictions for some given input distillation sample,
                                    which does not take the diversity across all local models into account, thus
                                    leading to degraded performance of the aggregated model, especially when
                                    some local models learn little knowledge about the sample. In this paper, we
                                    propose a new perspective that treats the local data in each client as a
                                    specific domain and design a novel domain knowledge aware federated
                                    distillation method, dubbed DaFKD, that can discern the importance of each
                                    model to the distillation sample, and thus is able to optimize the ensemble
                                    of soft predictions from diverse models. Specifically, we employ a domain
                                    discriminator for each client, which is trained to identify the correlation
                                    factor between the sample and the corresponding domain. Then, to facilitate
                                    the training of the domain discriminator while saving communication costs,
                                    we propose sharing its partial parameters with the classification model.
                                    Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that the
                                    proposed method can improve the model accuracy by up to 6.02% compared to
                                    state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

                                <p>Multimodal learning (MML) aims to jointly exploit the common priors of
                                    different modalities to compensate for their inherent limitations. However,
                                    existing MML methods often optimize a uniform objective for different
                                    modalities, leading to the notorious" modality imbalance" problem and
                                    counterproductive MML performance. To address the problem, some existing
                                    methods modulate the learning pace based on the fused modality, which is
                                    dominated by the better modality and eventually results in a limited
                                    improvement on the worse modal. To better exploit the features of
                                    multimodal, we propose Prototypical Modality Rebalance (PMR) to perform
                                    stimulation on the particular slow-learning modality without interference
                                    from other modalities. Specifically, we introduce the prototypes that
                                    represent general features for each class, to build the non-parametric
                                    classifiers for uni-modal performance evaluation. Then, we try to accelerate
                                    the slow-learning modality by enhancing its clustering toward prototypes.
                                    Furthermore, to alleviate the suppression from the dominant modality, we
                                    introduce a prototype-based entropy regularization term during the early
                                    training stage to prevent premature convergence. Besides, our method only
                                    relies on the representations of each modality and without restrictions from
                                    model structures and fusion methods, making it with great application
                                    potential for various scenarios. The source code is available here.</p>

                                <p>Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FedSSL) has emerged as a new paradigm for
                                    allowing distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning
                                    model over scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However,
                                    existing works for FedSSL rely on a closed-world assumption that all local
                                    training data and global testing data are from seen classes observed in the
                                    labeled dataset. It is crucial to go one step further: adapting FL models to
                                    an open-world setting, where unseen classes exist in the unlabeled data. In
                                    this paper, we propose a novel Federatedopen-world Semi-Supervised Learning
                                    (FedoSSL) framework, which can solve the key challenge in distributed and
                                    open-world settings, i.e., the biased training process for heterogeneously
                                    distributed unseen classes. Specifically, since the advent of a certain
                                    unseen class depends on a client basis, the locally unseen classes (exist in
                                    multiple clients) are likely to receive differentiated superior aggregation
                                    effects than the globally unseen classes (exist only in one client). We
                                    adopt an uncertainty-aware suppressed loss to alleviate the biased training
                                    between locally unseen and globally unseen classes. Besides, we enable a
                                    calibration module supplementary to the global aggregation to avoid
                                    potential conflicting knowledge transfer caused by inconsistent data
                                    distribution among different clients. The proposed FedoSSL can be easily
                                    adapted to state-of-the-art FL methods, which is also validated via
                                    extensive experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets (CIFAR-10,

                                <p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a special and practical setting in unsupervised
                                    domain adaptation, which allows a pre-trained model in a source domain to
                                    adapt to unlabeled test data in another target domain. To avoid the
                                    computation-intensive backbone fine-tuning process, the zero-shot
                                    generalization potentials of the emerging pre-trained vision-language models
                                    (e.g., CLIP, CoOp) are leveraged to only tune the run-time prompt for unseen
                                    test domains. However, existing solutions have yet to fully exploit the
                                    representation capabilities of pre-trained models as they only focus on the
                                    entropy-based optimization and the performance is far below the supervised
                                    prompt adaptation methods, e.g., CoOp. In this paper, we propose SwapPrompt,
                                    a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised
                                    contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation.
                                    SwapPrompt employs a dual prompts paradigm, i.e., an online prompt and a
                                    target prompt that averaged from the online prompt to retain historical
                                    information. In addition, SwapPrompt applies a swapped prediction mechanism,
                                    which takes advantage of the representation capabilities of pre-trained
                                    models to enhance the online prompt via contrastive learning. Specifically,
                                    we use the online prompt together with an augmented view of the input image
                                    to predict the class assignment generated by the target prompt together with
                                    an alternative augmented view of the same image. The proposed SwapPrompt can
                                    be easily deployed on vision-language models without additional requirement,
                                    and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art test-time
                                    adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets. It is also shown
                                    that SwapPrompt can even achieve comparable performance with supervised
                                    prompt adaptation methods.</p>

                                <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides additional physical
                                    channels to existing wireless network infrastructure and has attracted
                                    intensive research attention to enhance the communication capacity and
                                    extend additional user accommodation. Existing RIS researches mainly focus
                                    on optimizing the physical-layer channel utilization, and have yet to
                                    consider the multi-user fairness of the medium access process when involving
                                    the RIS channel. This article shows that RIS can lead to severely unbalanced
                                    access opportunities among RIS-assisted users and others from the
                                    experimental analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate that due to the capture
                                    effect and unbalanced receiving rate of management frames, RIS-assisted
                                    users can have unfair competitive priorities to normal users without RIS
                                    resources. To overcome such unfair access issues, we propose a novel
                                    antiunfair algorithm that allows equal access opportunities for all kinds of
                                    users in a RIS-assisted network. Specifically, we optimize the management
                                    frames’ modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selections to fight against
                                    unexpected bias to balance the access opportunities. We have conducted an
                                    experimental evaluation with a practical RIS system showing that the
                                    proposed antiunfair algorithm can significantly alleviate the fairness

                                <p>This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) aided
                                    anti-jamming communication strategy in the integrated terrestrial-satellite
                                    network (ITSN), where the IRS is exploited to mitigate jamming interference
                                    and enhance the integrated system communication performance. In such a
                                    network, the terrestrial network and satellite network are co-existing with
                                    a spectrum-sharing scheme in the presence of a multi-antenna jammer. We aim
                                    at maximizing the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all users by jointly optimizing
                                    the terrestrial beamformers and IRS phase shifts while considering the
                                    signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of legitimate
                                    users. Different from the non-convex optimization techniques utilized in the
                                    IRS-related problem, a novel optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning
                                    (DRL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages both the robustness of
                                    model-free learning approaches and the efficiency of model-based
                                    optimization methods. In the optimization module of the proposed algorithm,
                                    we analyze the smart jammer under the unknown jamming model and derive a
                                    lower bound of the anti-jamming uncertainty, such that the IRS-aided
                                    anti-jamming problem can be solved by alteration method with second-order
                                    cone programming (SOCP) algorithm and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
                                    technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the IRS can enhance the
                                    anti-jamming performance efficiently, and the proposed optimization-driven
                                    DRL algorithm can improve both the learning rate and the system performance
                                    compared with existing solutions.</p>

                                <p>Blockchain has been deemed as a promising solution for providing security and
                                    privacy protection in the next-generation wireless networks. Large-scale
                                    concurrent access for massive wireless devices to accomplish the consensus
                                    procedure may consume prohibitive communication and computing resources, and
                                    thus may limit the application of blockchain in wireless conditions. As most
                                    existing consensus protocols are designed for wired networks, directly apply
                                    them for wireless users equipment (UEs) may exhaust their scarce spectrum
                                    and computing resources. In this paper, we propose AirCon, a byzantine
                                    fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol for wireless UEs via the
                                    over-the-air computation. The novelty of AirCon is to take advantage of the
                                    intrinsic characteristic of the wireless channel and automatically achieve
                                    the consensus in the physical layer while receiving from the UEs, which
                                    greatly reduces the communication and computational cost that would be
                                    caused by traditional consensus protocols. We implement the AirCon protocol
                                    integrated into an LTE system and provide solutions to the critical issues
                                    for over-the-air consensus implementation. Experimental results are provided
                                    to show the feasibility of the proposed protocol, and simulation results to
                                    show the performance of the AirCon protocol under different wireless

                                <p>Federated learning (FL) has gained increasing attention due to its ability to
                                    collaboratively train while protecting client data privacy. However, vanilla
                                    FL cannot adapt to client heterogeneity, leading to a degradation in
                                    training efficiency due to stragglers, and is still vulnerable to privacy
                                    leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes RingSFL, a novel
                                    distributed learning scheme that integrates FL with a model split mechanism
                                    to adapt to client heterogeneity while maintaining data privacy. In RingSFL,
                                    all clients form a ring topology. For each client, instead of training the
                                    model locally, the model is split and trained among all clients along the
                                    ring through a pre-defined direction. By properly setting the propagation
                                    lengths of heterogeneous clients, the straggler effect is mitigated, and the
                                    training efficiency of the system is significantly enhanced. Additionally,
                                    since the local models are blended, it is less likely for an eavesdropper to
                                    obtain the complete model and recover the raw data, thus improving data
                                    privacy. The experimental results on both simulation and prototype systems
                                    show that RingSFL can achieve better convergence performance than benchmark
                                    methods on independently identically distributed (IID) and non-IID datasets,
                                    while effectively preventing eavesdroppers from recovering training data.

                                <p>Federated Learning (FL) system needs to incentivize clients since they may be
                                    reluctant to participate in the resource consuming process. Existing
                                    incentive mechanisms fail to construct a sustainable environment for the
                                    long-term development of FL system: 1) They seldom focus on system economic
                                    properties (e.g., social welfare, individual rationality, and incentive
                                    compatibility) to guarantee client attraction. 2) Current online auction
                                    modeling methods divide the whole continual process into multiple
                                    independent rounds and solve them one-by-one, which breaks the correlation
                                    between each round. Besides, the inherent characteristics of FL system
                                    (model-agnostic and privacy-sensitive) also prevent it from the optimal
                                    strategy by precise mathematical analysis. 3) Current system modelings
                                    ignore the practical problem of periodical client shifting, which cannot
                                    adaptively update its strategy to handle system dynamics. To overcome the
                                    above challenges, this paper proposes a long-term adaptive
                                    Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism for FL system, which
                                    incorporate a multi-branch deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm.
                                    First, VCG auction is the only one that can simultaneously guarantee all
                                    crucial economic properties. Second, we extend the economic properties to
                                    long-term forms and apply the experience-driven DRL algorithm to directly
                                    obtain long-term optimal strategy, without any prior system knowledge.
                                    Third, we reconstruct a multi-branch DRL network to accommodate periodical
                                    client shifting by adaptive decision head switching for different time
                                    periods. Finally, we theoretically prove he extended economic properties
                                    (i.e., IC) and conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets.
                                    Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the long-term social welfare of
                                    FL system increases by 36% with a 37% reduction in payment. Besides, the
                                    multi-branch network can adaptively handle periodical client shifting on the
                                    timeline.</p>

                                <p>Packet loss inferring can enable a transceiver to distinguish between channel
                                    impairment and collision for transmission failures, and thus can improve the
                                    network performance by exclusively performing rate adaptation or adjusting
                                    the medium access parameter. Machine learning methods from literature have
                                    shown great potential in producing models that can detect the loss causes
                                    over various network trace, however haven’t considered accurate data-driven
                                    loss inferring on resource-constrained devices that cannot accommodate deep
                                    models. In this paper, we propose a novel packet loss inferring framework
                                    that can train lightweight models to distinguish between channel losses and
                                    collisions by learning the data trace from both simulation and real devices.
                                    Specifically, we first train a sophisticated teacher model based on
                                    extensive simulation datasets, whose knowledge is then transferred to a
                                    small student model that can be deployed on tiny device. The
                                    simulation-reality distillation is conducted via personalized trace from
                                    each client correspondingly, whose performance bound is analytically
                                    guaranteed. We have implemented our method on real testbed and show that the
                                    network access performance can be significantly improved, especially for
                                    sudden network variations.</p>

                                <p>In distributed training, workers collaboratively refine the global model
                                    parameters by pushing their updates to the Parameter Server and pulling
                                    fresher parameters for the next iteration. This introduces high
                                    communication costs for training at scale, and incurs unproductive waiting
                                    time for workers. To minimize the waiting time, existing approaches overlap
                                    communication and computation for deep neural networks. Yet, these
                                    techniques not only require the layer-by-layer model structures, but also
                                    need significant efforts in runtime profiling and hyperparameter tuning. To
                                    make the overlapping optimization simple and generic , in this article, we
                                    propose a new Parameter Server framework. Our solution decouples the
                                    dependency between push and pull operations, and allows workers to eagerly
                                    pull the global parameters. This way, both push and pull operations can be
                                    easily overlapped with computations. Besides, the overlapping manner offers
                                    a different way to address the straggler problem, where the stale updates
                                    greatly retard the training process. In the new framework, with adequate
                                    information available to workers, they can explicitly modulate the learning
                                    rates for their updates. Thus, the global parameters can be less compromised
                                    by stale updates. We implement a prototype system in PyTorch and demonstrate
                                    its effectiveness on both CPU/GPU clusters. Experimental results show that
                                    our prototype saves up to 54% less time for each iteration and up to 37%
                                    fewer iterations for model convergence, achieving up to 2.86× speedup over
                                    widely-used synchronization schemes.</p>

                                <p>Wireless service providers (WSPs) are seeking cooperation to share both
                                    resources (spectrum, infrastructures) and costs. In particular, cooperation
                                    is critical for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications that value
                                    quality-of-service foremost. However, cooperation is inefficient without
                                    strong trust bases. Recently, blockchain arises as a promising solution to
                                    decentralized trust, owing to its transparency and immutability. Therefore,
                                    we propose a WSP cooperation framework based on blockchain, which keeps a
                                    shared ledger on resource utilization. In this paper, we first study the WSP
                                    selection problem of vehicles by evolutionary game. Then, we make the
                                    blockchain public to vehicles to maintain its decentralization and enhance
                                    its security by crowdsourcing idle computing resources from vehicles. To
                                    deal with the mobility of vehicles, as well as to improve the consensus
                                    efficiency, we propose delegated proof-of-work (DPoW) scheme, which
                                    introduces delegate nodes for participating in the blockchain consensus on
                                    behalf of the vehicles. The alternating direction method of multipliers
                                    (ADMM) optimization framework is further used to derive optimal consensus
                                    parameters including block size, computing resource demand of delegate
                                    nodes, and prices paid for vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to
                                    show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p>

                                <p>In recent years, personalized federated learning (pFL) has attracted
                                    increasing attention for its potential in dealing with statistical
                                    heterogeneity among clients. However, the state-of-the-art pFL methods rely
                                    on model parameters aggregation at the server side, which require all models
                                    to have the same structure and size, and thus limits the application for
                                    more heterogeneous scenarios. To deal with such model constraints, we
                                    exploit the potentials of heterogeneous model settings and propose a novel
                                    training framework to employ personalized models for different clients.
                                    Specifically, we formulate the aggregation procedure in original pFL into a
                                    personalized group knowledge transfer training algorithm, namely, KT-pFL,
                                    which enables each client to maintain a personalized soft prediction at the
                                    server side to guide the others’ local training. KT-pFL updates the
                                    personalized soft prediction of each client by a linear combination of all
                                    local soft predictions using a knowledge coefficient matrix, which can
                                    adaptively reinforce the collaboration among clients who own similar data
                                    distribution. Furthermore, to quantify the contributions of each client to
                                    others’ personalized training, the knowledge coefficient matrix is
                                    parameterized so that it can be trained simultaneously with the models. The
                                    knowledge coefficient matrix and the model parameters are alternatively
                                    updated in each round following the gradient descent way. Extensive
                                    experiments on various datasets (EMNIST, Fashion_MNIST, CIFAR-10) are
                                    conducted under different settings (heterogeneous models and data
                                    distributions). It is demonstrated that the proposed framework is the first
                                    federated learning paradigm that realizes personalized model training via
                                    parameterized group knowledge transfer while achieving significant
                                    performance gain comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>

                                <p>To enable large-scale and ubiquitous automotive network access, traditional
                                    vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies are evolving to the Internet of
                                    Vehicles (IoV) for increasing demands on emerging advanced vehicular
                                    applications, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and
                                    autonomous vehicles. In recent years, IoV technologies have been developed
                                    and achieved significant progress. However, it is still unclear what is the
                                    evolution path and what are the challenges and opportunities brought by IoV.
                                    For the aforementioned considerations, this article provides a thorough
                                    survey on the historical process and status quo of V2X technologies, as well
                                    as demonstration of emerging technology developing directions toward IoV. We
                                    first review the early stage when the dedicated short-range communications
                                    (DSRC) was issued as an important initial beginning and compared the
                                    cellular V2X with IEEE 802.11 V2X communications in terms of both the pros
                                    and cons. In addition, considering the advent of big data and cloud-edge
                                    regime, we highlight the key technical challenges and pinpoint the
                                    opportunities toward the big data-driven IoV and cloud-based IoV,
                                    respectively. We believe our comprehensive survey on evolutionary V2X
                                    technologies toward IoV can provide beneficial insights and inspirations for
                                    both academia and the IoV industry.</p>
